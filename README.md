# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Purpose
The purose of this project was to use my knowledge of Javascript, HTML, Plotly, and Bootstrap to create an interactive webpage containing data on different test subject's bacteria found in their bellybutton to analyze if type of bacteria is a propper candidate to be used for creating a form of synthetic beef. I used Plotly to create interactive charts in a JavaScript file that I then linked to my index.html file and customized using Bootstrap. Every time a new test subject is picked from the created drowdown list, the interactive charts update with the specified subject's information.
